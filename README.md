Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

 Artemis Financial is a financial services company that provides financial planning solutions and insurance solutions to their clients. The issue they wanted me to address was secure storage of private data and secure communications to upload and download data.

 What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

 This was a paticular challenge as some of the were unclear in some cases therefore I was able to research and scour the internet for the answers I was seeking. I was able to implement the neccessary standards once I was able to fully understand what i was coding very well. In some instances, other companies even want to steal your data. Secure code can mitigate a lot of threats out there. 

 What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

 I found the implementation of the hash algorithm to be a bit challenging. This is because the source code needed to create a class that threw an exception in order for the message digest to work. The dependency check tool was very helpful, saving a lot of time in detecting vulnerabilities automatically instead of having to manually check each dependency for vulnerabilities.

 How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

 I approached the need to increase security by first running the dependency checks. Then I analyzed the source code to make sure that nothing had an error. In the future it should be necessary to do penetration testing to better assess vulnerabilities.

 How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

 I ensured first that I had no code errors in Eclipse. Once I had the code error-free, I ran the service and opened up the localhost to confirm that the output was correct. Unit testing and manual code review can ensure functionality.

 What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

 I used the Internet to research current practices and algorithms and found that very helpful

 Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

 Aside from the class projects, I create my own and place them in my github. If not asked upfront, I genenrally post a link to my github on my linked in account or resume.
